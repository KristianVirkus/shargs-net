# shargs-net
Shell Arguments for .NET

The goal of this project is to implement a command line/shell arguments parsing library for .NET.

## Licence
This project is licenced under the MIT licence because:
* I love command line tools as one may focus on logic instead of UI implementation
* All command line parsing libraries for .NET that I known have drawbacks making them hard to use or adapt to my use cases
* And thus I want to promote the creation of command line tools and want you to use my library
